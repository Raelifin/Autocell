# Autocell
A cellular automaton scripting language and environment

This is a project that I did back in 2010 that involves using a general automaton language to run multiple types of cellular automata in the same environment. The initial version features Conway's Life, Brian's Brain, Seeds, Langton's Ant, and Wireworld. Autocell2 included support for images and a few other improvements. I never finished Autocell3, and it's pretty buggy, but in theory it has support for 3-dimensional automata and gif exporting. I was able to code an approximation of chess in the autocell language.
